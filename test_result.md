        comment: "✅ VERIFIED: Design consistency confirmed through manual code review. Header structure identical to main site (header-modern class), same logo-block structure with METRPC branding, consistent CSS files (content.css shared), same Font Awesome icons, same color variables and gradients. Only difference is CGV uses cgv.css instead of style.css for page-specific styling."
