The previous AI engineer successfully transformed a basic static HTML website for MetRPC into a modern, professional web presence. Initially misinterpreting the project as a full-stack application, the engineer promptly adapted after inspecting the file structure. The core task involved a comprehensive design overhaul of , which expanded to include intricate bug fixes for a parallax effect and form icon misalignment. The engineer meticulously created new legal pages (, , ) from user-provided content, ensuring consistent modern styling, responsive behavior, and functional internal links. The process was highly iterative, relying on CSS and JavaScript adjustments, validated through screenshots and a frontend testing agent. A recurring challenge was managing the local codebase with user-initiated Git pushes, requiring careful handling of repository synchronization. The engineer demonstrated strong front-end development, debugging, and user feedback integration skills.

<product_requirements>
The initial user request was to améliorer le désigne de la page web index.html and la rendre plus professionnel for MetRPC, an IT repair company. This evolved into a comprehensive design overhaul, targeting a modern, professional aesthetic and improved user experience. Explicit requirements included:
- Modernizing the main  page: redesigning the hero section, services, process flow, and contact form with modern typography (Google Fonts), engaging animations (AOS initially, then refined), and responsive layouts.
- Addressing identified bugs: fixing a moving parallax image in the hero section and correcting misaligned icons within the contact form.
- Creating and updating new static legal web pages, ensuring visual consistency with the main site:
    - Updating Conditions Générales de Vente () with new content (e.g., inclusion of new material sales) while maintaining the modern design.
    - Creating a Politique de confidentialité () page based on user-provided text.
    - Creating a Mentions légales () page, also from user-provided text.
- Ensuring all pages are fully responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices, and that all navigation links are functional and correctly updated to point to the new legal pages.

<code_architecture>
The application is structured as a static website, primarily using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The architecture does not involve a backend (FastAPI) or database (MongoDB) as initially anticipated by the AI engineer.



-   ****: This is the main landing page. It was heavily refactored to implement a modern design, including a fixed header, a hero section with a gradient overlay, redesigned service cards, a professional quote form, and a sleek footer. Significant HTML changes were made to integrate new sections and apply modern styling classes.
-   ****: The Conditions Générales de Vente page. Its structure was updated to include a modern header, a breadcrumb navigation, structured articles, and a consistent footer matching the main site. The content was updated per user request, including sections on material sales.
-   ****: The Politique de Confidentialité page. This file was newly created, implementing a consistent modern design. It includes a hero section, enterprise information card, interactive summary, and detailed GDPR articles, all styled similarly to .
-   ****: The Mentions Légales page. Also a newly created file, designed to align perfectly with the modern aesthetic of the  and  pages. It includes sections on editor, hosting, intellectual property, and data protection, presented in a clean, professional layout.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in the final validation phase of the application following a user-initiated  from the GitHub repository (). This pull updated the local codebase with the latest user-committed changes, including the deletion of some old files ( text file, ) and modifications to core HTML and CSS files.

The AI engineer's actions involved:
1.  **Repository Synchronization**: Successfully re-configured the Git remote and pulled the latest changes, ensuring the local environment was up-to-date.
2.  **Content Verification**: Confirmed that all modernized pages (, , , ), along with their respective CSS and JavaScript files, were present and correctly updated post-pull.
3.  **Visual and Functional Validation (Partial)**:
    *   A screenshot was taken for  (Chat Message 268), confirming its modern header, hero section, buttons, and feature/stats sections were functioning as expected.
    *   A screenshot for  (Chat Message 270) validated its modern design and content display.
    *   A screenshot for  (Chat Message 272) confirmed its proper rendering with the consistent modern style.
4.  **Pending Validation**: The final action taken by the AI engineer was to initiate the testing for the  page (Chat Message 273), but the trajectory ends before this test's results are observed.

The product is currently in a highly modernized state, featuring a professional and responsive design across ,  (updated with new content),  (newly created), and  (newly created). All previously reported bugs (parallax effect, form icon misalignment) have been resolved. The immediate task is to confirm the integrity of the  page after the recent repository synchronization.
